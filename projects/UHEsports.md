The University of Hawai’i Esports Website is a web application that I helped redesign as part of a team project in August 2023. The project taught me how to remodel and implement a responsive webpage using modern web development tools.

The website is built using React.js with Material UI for the user interface and is hosted on the University of Hawai’i servers. Over several months, we worked as a team of 3 developers and 5 designers to create a dynamic and responsive platform for esports.

In this project, I gained experience with full-stack web development using a waterfall methodology. We utilized Jira for task management and implemented frameworks to handle dynamic content, improving the overall user experience.

Our webpage is currently under development, our test page can be found here at: [hawaii.edu/testesports](https://www.hawaii.edu/testesports/#/)

Here is some example code that I created:
